        "The resume screening system demonstrates effective candidate differentiation by combining semantic similarity between resumes and the job description with explicit skill matching. Candidates ranked at the top show strong alignment with the role, both in the language used in their resumes and in the presence of required skills. Mid-ranked candidates typically demonstrate partial alignment but are missing one or more key skills, which lowers their overall score. Lower-ranked candidates show limited relevance to the job description or lack critical skills, even if they list several general competencies. Overall, the ranking results indicate that the model is consistently prioritizing candidates based on role fit, supporting recruiters in focusing their attention on the most relevant applicants while keeping final hiring decisions human-led."
